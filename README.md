# F1STATS
Get Formula 1 data from an API and present it through Flask.

A website that displays information for any Formula 1 season.
Use the text box in the upper-left corner to specify a year, and you will be redirected to that year's race calender. From there you can access each invidual grand prix's race and qualifying results, as well as the driver and constructor standings.

Note that some qualifying and fastest lap data isn't available for older races, in which case an error message will appear.
